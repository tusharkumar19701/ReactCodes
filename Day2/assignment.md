# What is NPM?

Ans: NPM, or Node Package Manager, is a package manager for JavaScript programming language and is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage and distribute packages (or modules) of reusable JavaScript code. Developers can use NPM to install, share, and manage dependencies in their projects.

- Package Management: NPM allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries or tools (packages) that can be used in their projects.

- Dependency Management: NPM helps manage project dependencies by keeping track of which packages a project relies on and ensuring that the correct versions of those packages are installed.

- Command-Line Interface: NPM provides a command-line interface that developers use to interact with the package manager.

- Versioning: NPM uses semantic versioning to manage package versions. 

- Scripts: NPM allows developers to define and run scripts in their projects.


# What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

Ans: Parcel and Webpack are both popular build tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, used to bundle and optimize web assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. They help streamline the development workflow and improve the performance of web applications. While they serve similar purposes, there are some differences in their approaches and configurations.

### PARCEL:
- Zero Configuration: One of the key features of Parcel is its zero-configuration setup. It aims to require minimal to no configuration, making it easy for developers to get started quickly without the need for a complex setup.

- Automatic Asset Handling: Parcel has built-in support for various asset types, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images. It automatically analyzes your project's dependencies and bundles them accordingly.

- Fast and Efficient: Parcel uses a parallelized approach to build, which means it can process multiple tasks concurrently, leading to faster build times. It also provides caching for improved performance during subsequent builds.

- Built-in Development Server: Parcel comes with a development server that makes it easy to test and debug applications locally. It also supports hot module replacement (HMR), allowing developers to see changes in real-time without a full page reload.

### WEBPACK:
- Highly Configurable: Webpack is a highly configurable module bundler that allows developers to fine-tune the build process according to their specific project requirements. While this flexibility provides more control, it can also make the initial setup more complex.

- Loaders and Plugins: Webpack uses loaders to process different types of files and plugins to perform additional tasks during the build process. This extensibility allows developers to integrate various tools and optimizations seamlessly.

- Code Splitting: Webpack supports code splitting, which allows developers to split their code into smaller chunks. This is beneficial for optimizing page load times, especially for larger applications.

- Wide Adoption: Webpack has been widely adopted in the JavaScript community and has a large ecosystem of plugins and loaders. Many popular frameworks and tools integrate with or recommend Webpack as part of their build process.

## Why do we need build tools like Parcel or Webpack?
- Bundle and Minify Code: Build tools bundle multiple source files into a single file, reducing the number of requests made by the browser. Additionally, they can minify code by removing unnecessary whitespace and renaming variables, leading to smaller file sizes.

- Dependency Management: Build tools help manage dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions of libraries are included in the final bundle. They can also handle transpilation of modern JavaScript features to ensure compatibility with different browsers.

- Optimize Assets: These tools can optimize various assets, such as images and stylesheets, to reduce their size and improve overall application performance.

- Code Splitting: Tools like Webpack enable code splitting, allowing developers to split their code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, improving the initial page load time.

- Development Workflow: Build tools provide a streamlined development workflow with features like hot module replacement, allowing developers to see changes in real-time without a full page refresh.


# What is '.parcel-cache' ?
Ans: The .parcel-cache directory is a cache folder created by the Parcel bundler during the build process. Parcel uses caching to improve the performance of subsequent builds by storing intermediate build artifacts and avoiding unnecessary reprocessing of files.

Here's a breakdown of the purpose of the .parcel-cache directory:

- Cache Storage: The .parcel-cache directory stores various cache files generated by Parcel during the build process. These cache files include information about the project's dependencies, intermediate build artifacts, and other data that Parcel can reuse to speed up the build process.

- Cache Keying: Parcel uses a content-based cache mechanism, where each cache entry is associated with a specific content hash. If the content of a file or a dependency hasn't changed since the last build, Parcel can retrieve the cached result instead of rebuilding it, leading to faster build times.

- Performance Improvement: Caching is a common technique employed by build tools to avoid redundant work. By storing and reusing previously computed results, Parcel can significantly reduce the time it takes to build a project, especially during development when files are frequently changed and rebuilt.

- Cache Clearing: In some cases, you might encounter issues during the build process, and clearing the cache could be a troubleshooting step. Deleting the .parcel-cache directory and then running the build again will force Parcel to rebuild everything from scratch.


# What is npx?
Ans: npx is a package runner tool that comes with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). It allows you to execute npm packages directly from the command line without having to install them globally. The primary purpose of npx is to make it easy to run binaries that are included in npm packages.

Here are some key aspects of npx:

- Execute Binaries: npx is used to execute binaries from npm packages. Instead of installing a package globally, you can use npx to run a command from a specific package as if it were installed globally.

- Local Package Execution: If a package has a binary executable (e.g., a command-line tool) defined in its package.json file, you can run it using npx without installing the package globally or adding it to your project dependencies.

- Execute Latest Version: npx can automatically download and execute the latest version of a package if it's not already installed on your system. This helps ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of a command-line tool.

- Temporary Environment: When you run a command with npx, it creates a temporary environment for the execution of that command. This means that it won't interfere with your global or project-specific dependencies.

# Difference between 'dependencies' and 'devDependencies'
Ans: 
In a Node.js project, the dependencies and devDependencies sections in the package.json file are used to distinguish between dependencies needed for runtime and those needed only for development and testing purposes. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:

### dependencies:
- Runtime Dependencies: The packages listed under the dependencies section are the ones that your application relies on during runtime. These are essential for the application to work in a production environment.

- Installed with npm install --production: When you run npm install without any flags, both dependencies and devDependencies are installed. However, if you use the --production flag (for example, during deployment), npm will skip installing packages listed in the devDependencies section.

- Examples: Libraries, frameworks, and modules that your application uses during its normal operation should be listed as dependencies.

### devDependencies:
- Development and Testing Dependencies: The packages listed under the devDependencies section are used during development, testing, and the build process. They are not necessary for the actual execution of the application in a production environment.

- Not Installed in Production: When you deploy your application to a production server, you typically don't need the packages listed in devDependencies. They are excluded when you use npm install --production.

- Examples: Testing frameworks, build tools, linters, and other tools that assist in development and testing should be listed as devDependencies.

### When to Use Each:
- dependencies: Use this section for packages that your application requires to run. These are the dependencies that your users will need when they install and use your application.

- devDependencies: Use this section for tools and libraries that are only needed during development. These might include testing libraries, build tools, transpilers, and other utilities that aren't part of the final deployed application.


# What is TreeShaking ?
Ans: Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the context of JavaScript module bundlers, such as Webpack and Rollup. It refers to the process of eliminating dead (unused) code or unused exports from the final bundle to reduce its size.

The name "tree shaking" is derived from the idea of shaking a tree and causing dead leaves to fall off, leaving only the necessary branches and leaves.

Here's how tree shaking works:

- ES6 Modules: Tree shaking is particularly effective with ES6 module syntax (import and export statements). ES6 modules have a static structure, which means that the dependencies can be analyzed at build time.

- Unused Code Elimination: During the build process, the bundler analyzes the code and identifies modules, functions, or variables that are not used in the application. It then eliminates these unused pieces of code from the final bundle.

- Reduced Bundle Size: The result is a smaller bundle size that only includes the code necessary for the application to run. This can lead to faster loading times for web applications, especially in scenarios where large libraries or frameworks are used but not all features are utilized.

- Configuration and Tool Support: To make tree shaking work effectively, both the bundler and the code must support it. Tree shaking is often associated with module bundlers like Webpack and Rollup, and it requires proper configuration and the use of tools that support static analysis.

# What is Hot Module Replacement?
Ans: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in software development that allows you to update or replace parts of your application in real-time while it's running, without the need for a full page or application reload. It enables developers to see the immediate effects of their code changes without disrupting the overall application state. HMR is commonly used in web development with tools like webpack to enhance the development experience by providing quick and seamless updates during the development process.

# What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
Ans: The .gitignore file is a configuration file used by Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored when tracking changes in a Git repository. When you add files and directories to the .gitignore file, Git will not include them in version control, preventing them from being committed to the repository. This is useful for excluding files generated during the development process, temporary files, and other items that are not essential for sharing and collaborating on the codebase.

Here are some guidelines on what to include and not include in a .gitignore file:

## What to Include in .gitignore:
- Node.js and npm:
1. node_modules/: The directory where Node.js dependencies are installed.

- Build Artifacts:

1. dist/: The directory where build artifacts are generated.
1. build/: Another common name for build output directories.

- Editor and IDE Files:
1. .vscode/: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.
1. .idea/: Configuration files for IntelliJ IDEA.
1. .DS_Store: macOS system file.

- Operating System and Temporary Files:
1. .DS_Store: macOS system file.
1. .thumbs/: Thumbnails directory in macOS.
1. Thumbs.db: Windows system file.

- Logs and Debugging Files:
1. *.log: Log files.
1. npm-debug.log: npm debug log.
1. .log/: Directory containing log files.

- Environment-specific Files:
1. .env: Environment variable files.

- Package Manager Files:
1. yarn.lock: Yarn lock file.
1. package-lock.json: npm package lock file.

- Compiled Code:
1. *.min.js: Minified JavaScript files.
1. *.min.css: Minified CSS files.
1. *.bundle.js: Bundled JavaScript files.

## What Not to Include in .gitignore:
- Source Code Files:
1. Do not include source code files that are essential for the project.

- Configuration Files:
1. Do not ignore configuration files that are required for the project to run. This includes files like .babelrc, .eslintrc, etc.

- Sensitive Information:
1. Do not include files or directories containing sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or private keys.

- Documentation:
1. Do not ignore documentation files if they are important for the project.

- User-specific Files:
1. Avoid including user-specific files or directories that are not relevant to the overall project.



# Difference between package.json and package-lock.json
Ans: package.json and package-lock.json are both files used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies, but they serve different purposes and contain different information.

### package.json:
1. Purpose:
package.json is a configuration file that contains metadata about the project and specifies the project's dependencies.

1. Metadata:
It includes information such as the project name, version, description, entry points (main file), scripts, and more.

1. Dependencies and DevDependencies:
It lists the project's dependencies (dependencies needed for runtime) under the dependencies property and development dependencies (dependencies needed for development and testing) under the devDependencies property.

1. Version Ranges:
It allows the use of version ranges for dependencies, which means that the specified version may be a minimum required version but not necessarily an exact version.

1. Updated Manually:
Developers typically update the package.json file manually or by using the npm CLI commands (npm install package-name --save or npm install package-name --save-dev).

### package-lock.json:
1. Purpose:
package-lock.json is an automatically generated file that provides a more deterministic and reproducible build by locking down the versions of dependencies and their transitive dependencies.

1. Exact Versions:
It includes exact versions of all installed dependencies and their sub-dependencies. This ensures that every developer working on the project gets the same dependency tree with the same versions.
1. Avoids "Dependency Hell":
It helps avoid "dependency hell," where different developers or environments end up with different versions of the same dependency, leading to inconsistencies and potential issues.

1. Generated Automatically:
It is generated automatically by npm when installing or updating dependencies using commands like npm install. Developers generally don't modify this file manually.
1. Integrity Checks:
It includes integrity checksums for each installed package, ensuring that the installed package matches the expected package based on its version and contents.





# Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
Ans: 
package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm to lock down the versions of your project's dependencies and their transitive dependencies. It is intended to ensure a consistent and reproducible build environment across different machines and development stages. While it's technically possible to modify package-lock.json manually, it is generally not recommended for the following reasons:

- Consistency Across Environments:
package-lock.json is crucial for maintaining consistency in your project's dependencies. Modifying it manually may lead to inconsistencies between development environments, making it difficult to reproduce builds reliably.

- Version Mismatch:
Manually modifying versions in package-lock.json could result in installing different versions of dependencies than what is specified in the file. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the actual installed versions may not match what is documented in the lock file.

- Integrity Checks:
package-lock.json includes integrity checksums for each installed package to ensure that the installed package matches the expected package based on its version and contents. Manually changing versions may break these integrity checks.

- Collaboration and Teamwork:
When working in a team or collaborating on a project, it's essential to have a shared and consistent set of dependencies. Manually modifying package-lock.json may introduce inconsistencies among team members and cause issues when sharing code.

- Reproducibility:
The purpose of package-lock.json is to ensure reproducibility of builds. If you modify it, you may lose the benefits of this file, and it could lead to difficulties in debugging, testing, and deploying your application.

- Tooling and CI/CD:
Automated build systems, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD) systems rely on package-lock.json for predictable and reproducible builds. Modifying this file can introduce uncertainties and make it challenging to maintain a stable CI/CD pipeline.




# What is node_modules?
Ans: node_modules is a directory that contains the dependencies (libraries, packages, modules) required by a Node.js project. When you run npm install or a similar package manager command, it installs these dependencies into the node_modules directory, creating a hierarchical structure that reflects the dependency tree of your project.

## Should node_modules be pushed to Git?
In general, it's not a good idea to push the entire node_modules directory to a version control system like Git, and here's why:

- Size and Redundancy:
The node_modules directory can be very large, containing numerous files and folders. Including it in your Git repository would bloat the repository size, making it slower to clone and less efficient to work with.

- Version Control System Limitations:
Version control systems like Git are not designed to handle binary files or large directories efficiently. Pushing and pulling large node_modules directories can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

- Dependency Management:
node_modules is generated by package managers (npm, Yarn) based on the dependencies listed in your package.json file. Including it in version control is unnecessary because it can be generated by others when they clone your repository.

### What to Do Instead:
- Use a .gitignore file:
Add node_modules to your .gitignore file to ensure that Git ignores this directory when you commit changes. This prevents unnecessary and large binary files from being included in your version control system.
Example .gitignore entry:
```ruby
# .gitignore
node_modules/
Include package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock):
```

Version control the package.json file, which lists your project's dependencies. Additionally, include package-lock.json (for npm) or yarn.lock (for Yarn) to lock down dependency versions and ensure consistency across different environments.
Example .gitignore with included lock file:

```ruby
# .gitignore
node_modules/
!package.json
!package-lock.json  # or !yarn.lock for Yarn
```

- Use Dependency Management Tools:
When sharing your project with others or deploying it, provide instructions for them to run npm install or yarn install to generate the node_modules directory based on the dependencies listed in your package.json file.


# What is a dist folder?
Ans: 
The dist folder, short for "distribution," is a common naming convention for a directory that contains the distribution or output files of a software project after it has been built or compiled. The contents of the dist folder typically represent the final, deployable version of the application, optimized for production.


# What is browserlist?
Ans: Browserslist is a configuration file used by various front-end tools, such as Autoprefixer and Babel, to determine the list of target browsers for a web project. It allows developers to specify which browsers their project should support, and the tools will then automatically adjust or polyfill the code accordingly.

# Caret (^):
The caret (^) is used to specify a version range that allows updates for the most significant non-breaking releases. The version range is defined as follows:

^1.2.3: Allows updates to any version in the range 1.2.3 to <2.0.0.
The caret allows changes that do not include breaking changes. For example, if the current version is 1.2.3, you might get an update to 1.3.0 or 1.4.0 but not to 2.0.0.

# Tilde (~):
The tilde (~) is used to specify a version range that allows updates for the most significant and minor non-breaking releases. The version range is defined as follows:

~1.2.3: Allows updates to any version in the range 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.
The tilde allows only the patch version to be updated. For example, if the current version is 1.2.3, you might get an update to 1.2.4 but not to 1.3.0.




# Transitive dependencies
Ans: Suppose entities A, B, and C exist such that the following statements hold:

A → B direct dependency relationship exists.
There is no B → A relationship.
B → C direct dependency relationship exists.
Then the functional dependency A → C is a transitive dependency
A transitive dependency is an indirect dependency relationship between software components.
Transitive dependencies are dependencies that are not directly declared in your project but are brought in because they are required by one or more of your project's direct dependencies. In other words, they are dependencies of dependencies.
